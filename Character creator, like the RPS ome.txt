Character creator, like the RPS omega one but with skill point allocation

str - dmg
hit - hit rate
avo - avoid chance

actual hit chance% = hit - avo (hit chance cannot be below 0%)

def - defence

actual dmg = dmg - def (dmg cannot go below 0)

hp - hit points

Character class - holds stats, universal actions

Attack moves return their full damage, method to retrieve defence returns def

Attacker subclass
Defender subclass
subclasses hold unique moves
ideally moves are designed such that multiple stat spreads have something they can build towards (for later)
special moves ideas
  - Uses non str stat for calcs?
  - Not necessarily an attack (temp buff, stack type buff etc)
  - Dmg calc must be AtkStat - DefStat, but the used stats can change

Stat selector class - exists to interface stat allocation, and to create the player objects

Taking damage:

Takedamage method accepts Self defence calc AND Other's move method (returns dmg)
DMG = OTHERDMG - SELFDEF


BATTLE SECTION:
Class for battle area?
runs methods for gameplay loop, checks if someones dead, 

Dependencies:
Player depends on Stat selector
Battle depends on Player

STAT SELECTION:
Allow full freedom, players can go 0 in a stat if they want to (except hit)

Ranges:
str: 0-any
hit: 80-any
avo: 0-any
def: 0-any
HP: 14-any

50 Skill points to allocate, each point gives +2 to any stat they choose

Keys 1,2,3,4,5 increase the respective stat, Q,W,E,R,T decrease
